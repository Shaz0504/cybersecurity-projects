# Internal Penetration Test â€“ Windows & Linux Servers

This project simulates a black-box internal penetration test conducted against a fictional enterprise environment with Windows and Linux servers. The objective was to identify exploitable services, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and ultimately compromise the domain controller through lateral movement and credential harvesting.

The engagement mirrors realistic red team techniques aligned with internal threat actor behavior.

## Objectives

- Discover and exploit unpatched and misconfigured internal services  
- Escalate privileges on both Linux and Windows systems  
- Capture and crack password hashes to gain lateral access  
- Extract NTDS.dit and SYSTEM hive from the domain controller

---

## Tools & Techniques Used

- Nmap, Metasploit (vsftpd, EternalBlue), Distcc  
- WMI exploitation, Responder for LLMNR poisoning  
- John the Ripper for password cracking  
- SSH persistence, NTDS.dit extraction and credential dump
