# Internal Penetration Test – Windows & Linux Servers

This project simulates a black-box internal penetration test targeting Windows and Linux servers within a fictional enterprise. The objective was to identify vulnerabilities, gain privilege escalation, maintain persistence, and ultimately compromise the domain controller through lateral movement and credential harvesting.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Identify and exploit vulnerable internal services  
- Escalate privileges on Linux and Windows systems  
- Capture and crack hashes for lateral movement  
- Extract NTDS.dit and SYSTEM hive from the domain controller

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- Nmap, Metasploit, Distcc, vsftpd, EternalBlue  
- WMI, Responder, John the Ripper  
- SSH persistence and privilege escalation  
- NTDS.dit extraction and credential dump

---

## 🔍 Highlights

- Exploited legacy services (vsftpd, SMB) for initial access  
- Escalated to root/admin using weak credentials  
- Captured NTLMv2 hashes and cracked them for lateral movement  
- Fully compromised the domain and exfiltrated credentials
