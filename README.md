# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a collection of hands-on projects simulating real-world scenarios in SOC operations, threat detection, phishing analysis, endpoint response, digital forensics, and internal penetration testing.

Each project is built using industry-standard tools and aligned with SOC workflows, detection engineering principles, and investigative analysis practices.

## Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [SOC Alert Triage – Splunk](./soc-alert-triage-splunk) | Built custom detection rules in Splunk to identify brute-force logins, privilege escalation attempts, and web-layer anomalies using Apache and Windows logs. Delivered MITRE ATT&CK mapping and dashboard visualizations. |
| [Wireshark Network Assessment](./wireshark-network-assessment) | Conducted a vulnerability scan and traffic analysis using Wireshark and Nmap. Identified suspicious HTTP/ARP behavior, DNS manipulation, and port-level access anomalies. |
| [Network Security Lab – IDS & Firewalld](./network-security-lab) | Created IDS rules using Snort, configured firewalld zones, and analyzed alert data in Security Onion. Focused on threat detection, segmentation, and policy enforcement. |
| [Phishing Simulation & IOC Analysis](./phishing-ioc-analysis) | Designed and launched a phishing campaign using GoPhish and SendGrid. Developed a Bash-based script to extract IOCs from headers and links. Followed up with email triage analysis. |
| [Internal Penetration Test – Windows & Linux](./pentest-windows-linux) | Simulated a lateral movement attack on internal networks. Exploited misconfigurations, cracked password hashes, and exfiltrated NTDS.dit using Metasploit, Responder, and enumeration tools. |
| [iPhone Digital Forensics – Insider Threat](./iphone-digital-forensics-autopsy) | Used Autopsy to investigate a simulated data theft case. Analyzed call logs, GPS, image metadata, SMS, and browsing artifacts to create a timeline of events and link user actions to the incident. |

## About Me

I'm a Security+ and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) professional with hands-on experience in SOC alert triage, endpoint investigation, phishing detection, and adversary emulation. These projects reflect my practical approach to cybersecurity analysis, incident response, and detection engineering.

I am actively pursuing SOC Analyst and Cybersecurity Analyst roles across Canada.
