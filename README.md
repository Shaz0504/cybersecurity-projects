# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a collection of hands-on projects simulating real-world scenarios in SOC operations, threat detection, phishing analysis, endpoint response, digital forensics, and internal penetration testing.

Each project was built using industry-standard tools and methodologies to demonstrate investigative thinking, technical skills, and familiarity with modern security workflows.

## Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [SOC Alert Triage – Splunk](./soc-alert-triage-splunk) | Used Splunk to detect brute-force attacks, suspicious logins, and privilege escalation attempts from Apache and Windows logs. Included MITRE ATT&CK mapping and dashboard visualizations. |
| [Phishing Simulation & IOC Analysis](./phishing-ioc-analysis) | Simulated phishing campaigns using GoPhish and SendGrid. Developed a Bash-based detection script to identify suspicious email indicators and extract IOCs. |
| [Internal Penetration Test – Windows & Linux](./pentest-windows-linux) | Simulated an internal red team attack. Exploited legacy services, escalated privileges on Windows and Linux, and exfiltrated domain credentials (NTDS.dit). |
| [iPhone Digital Forensics – Insider Threat](./iphone-digital-forensics-autopsy) | Investigated a simulated insider theft case using Autopsy. Analyzed SMS, voicemails, GPS metadata, and browser history to build a timeline and link suspect behavior. |
