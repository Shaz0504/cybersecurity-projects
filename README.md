# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a collection of hands-on projects that demonstrate my skills in threat detection, SOC analysis, endpoint response, phishing investigation, digital forensics, and internal penetration testing.

These projects were built using real-world tools and scenarios, simulating the types of incidents and investigations performed in modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and red/blue team environments.

## 📁 Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [🔍 SOC Alert Triage – Splunk](./soc-alert-triage-splunk) | Used Splunk to detect brute-force attacks, suspicious logins, and escalation patterns using Apache and Windows logs. Included MITRE ATT&CK mapping and visual dashboards. |
| [🎣 Phishing Simulation & IOC Analysis](./phishing-ioc-analysis) | Simulated phishing campaigns with GoPhish, SendGrid, and a custom domain. Developed a Bash-based detection script for email analysis and IOC extraction. |
| [💣 Internal Penetration Test – Windows & Linux](./pentest-windows-linux) | Simulated an internal red team attack: exploited legacy Linux and Windows services, escalated privileges, planted persistence, and extracted domain credentials (NTDS.dit). |
| [📱 iPhone Digital Forensics – Insider Threat](./iphone-digital-forensics-autopsy) | Investigated an insider theft case using Autopsy. Analyzed mobile artifacts (messages, GPS, voicemails, web history) to build an evidence timeline and identify co-conspirators. |
