# Digital Forensics â€“ iPhone Investigation (Insider Threat Case)

This project simulates a digital forensic investigation of an iPhone involved in a suspected insider theft at Pure Gold Credit Union (PGCU). Using Autopsy and SQLite, I extracted key artifacts including messages, emails, voicemails, location metadata, and browsing history to reconstruct the timeline of events and identify co-conspirators.

The investigation followed industry-standard practices for evidence handling, chain of custody, and forensic analysis.
