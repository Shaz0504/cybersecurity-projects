# Phishing Simulation & IOC Detection

This project demonstrates a complete phishing lifecycle — from red team simulation to blue team detection. We launched phishing campaigns using GoPhish and SendGrid, analyzed user interaction metrics, and developed a Bash-based detection script to identify suspicious emails.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- GoPhish, SendGrid, Carrd.co
- DigitalOcean, Bash, Fetchmail
- Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo
- OSINT, custom domains

## 📊 Campaign Results
- **Splunk Campaign**: 31 sent / 21 opened / 6 clicked (29%)
- **Cybersecurity Summit Campaign**: 31 sent / 20 opened / 6 clicked (30%)

## 🔍 Detection Logic
The Bash script detects:
- Suspicious sender domains
- Generic greetings and urgency
- Malicious links and file attachments
