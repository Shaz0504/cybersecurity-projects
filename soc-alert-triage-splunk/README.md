# SOC Alert Triage Using Splunk SIEM

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation using Splunk. It focuses on detecting, classifying, and responding to brute-force and DDoS-style behavior based on log correlation and alert prioritization.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk** (SIEM)
- Apache Web Server logs
- Windows Event Logs (Security, System)
- Splunk CIM (Common Information Model)
- CyberChef, VirusTotal

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Ingest and normalize Apache and Windows logs in Splunk
- Create detection rules for brute-force logins, account lockouts, and POST request anomalies
- Build dashboards to visualize geolocation, IP frequency, and request behavior
- Map attack techniques to MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., Credential Access, Initial Access)
- Document indicators of compromise (IOCs) and provide remediation recommendations

## 📄 Deliverables
- ✅ Case Study Report (PDF): analysis, alerting logic, MITRE mapping, and response  
- ✅ Presentation (PPT): summary of findings and SOC-style recommendations
